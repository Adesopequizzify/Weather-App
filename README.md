Welcome to the Weather App project! This simple web application allows users to dynamically fetch and display weather information for different cities. The app updates the weather every 30 seconds and provides a search feature to look up specific cities' weather conditions.

## Features

- Fetch and display weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Dynamically update weather information for different cities.
- Neumorphism-styled search form for city lookup.
- Font Awesome search icon for the search button.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adesopequizzify/weather-app.git
    ```

2. Open the project folder and edit `script.js`:
   Replace `'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY'` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the Weather App.
